# Battleship Game
1. A brief (3-5 sentences) description of your planned project
  - My project is to recreate the game Sea Battle. I will not be using simple printed outputs,
    but add images so that the players can actually see the image when the ship is correctly hit.
    I also plan to create sound effects when a player hits a ship correctly.
3. For each of three functions, a very brief (1-2 sentences) description of what the function will do.
  - Place ships in random areas within the provided grids correctly.
  - Create a graphic of the ships, so they appear when hit correctly. 
  - Check the player's input whether it is within the correct grids and if the coordinates are correctly typed in.
     Also, check if the player's input is a hit or a miss, and add sound effects if the ship is hit.
