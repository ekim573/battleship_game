1. A brief (3-5 sentences) description of your planned project
  - My project is to recreate the game Sea Battle. I will not be using simple printed outputs,
    but add in graphics so that the players can actually see the image when the ship is correctly hit.
    I can also create sound effects when a player hits a ship correctly.
3. For each of three functions, a very brief(1-2 sentences) descroption of what the function will do
  - Place ships in random areas within the provided grids.
  - Create a graphic of the ships, so they appear when all are hit correctly.
  - Check the player's input whether it is within the correct grids and if the coordinates are correclty typed in.
     Also, check if the player's input is a hit or a miss and add sound effect if the ship is hit.
